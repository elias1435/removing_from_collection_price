You can do it with some code changes
Please go to Online Store > Themes > Actions > Edit Code > Snippets > price.liquid
Find this line of code
{% endcomment %}

assign money_price = 'products.product.price.from_price_html' | t: price: money_price

{% comment %}
Instead of deleting this line, we will change the variable name money_price to money_price2
Now add a new line of code under that

note: if you don't want to add "/lb" aftre currency just leave it blank ""
{% endcomment %}

assign money_price = price | money_with_currency | append: "/lb"
